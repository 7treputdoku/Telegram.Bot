However, this does not mean that you are out of luck. There are some unofficial sources that provide solutions to some or all of the exercises in the book. These sources are not endorsed by the publisher or the author, and they may contain errors or inaccuracies, so use them at your own risk. Here are some of the options you can try:
 
- **Internet Archive**: This is a non-profit digital library that offers free access to millions of books, movies, music, and other media. You can find a scanned copy of the second edition of How to Prove It on this site[^1^]. However, this is not a solution manual, but the actual textbook. You will still have to work out the solutions yourself.
- **Anna's Archive**: This is a website that claims to offer free PDF downloads of various books and documents. One of the files they have is an instructor's solution manual for the third edition of How to Prove It[^2^]. However, this site is not very reliable or trustworthy. The file may be corrupted, infected with malware, or removed at any time. You should be very careful when downloading anything from this site.
- **GitHub**: This is a platform that hosts code repositories for software development and collaboration. Some users have created their own solutions to the exercises in How to Prove It and shared them on GitHub. For example, you can find one such repository here[^3^]. However, these solutions are not verified or peer-reviewed, and they may not follow the same conventions or methods as the book. You should use them as a reference only and not as a substitute for your own work.
- **Google Drive**: This is a cloud storage service that allows users to upload and share files online. Some users have uploaded copies of How to Prove It or its solution manual on Google Drive and made them publicly accessible. For example, you can find one such file here[^4^]. However, these files are also unauthorized and potentially illegal. They may be deleted or blocked at any time by the owner or Google. You should respect the intellectual property rights of the publisher and the author and not download or distribute these files.

In conclusion, finding a free solution manual for Velleman's How to Prove It is not easy or advisable. You may encounter various risks and ethical issues along the way. The best way to learn from this book is to read it carefully and try to solve the exercises yourself. If you need help, you can consult your instructor, classmates, tutors, or online forums. Remember that learning how to prove things is a valuable skill that requires practice and patience.
